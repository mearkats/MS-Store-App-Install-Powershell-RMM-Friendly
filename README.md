# Microsoft Store Install Powershell Script - RMM Friendly!!

Hello and welcome!
This script allows the user to install a Microsoft Store App. As the title suggests, its RMM friendly, tested with Datto RMM and Tactical RMM.

The Script Uses the "RunAsUser" module created by Kelvin Tegelaar (https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/RunAsUser). A user has to be logged in for the script to work. The script, as of 22/09/2022, will now feed the output of the installation into the RMM.
