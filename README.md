# Microsoft Store Install Powershell Script - RMM Friendly!!

Hello and welcome!
This script allows the user to install a Microsoft Store App. As the title suggests, its RMM friendly, tested with Datto RMM and Tactical RMM.

The Script Uses the "RunAsUser" module created by Kelvin Tegelaar (https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/RunAsUser). A user has to be logged in for the script to work. Please bear in mind, this doesn't feed anything back to the RMM at this time.
